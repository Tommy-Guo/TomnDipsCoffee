  "general_desc": "% Arabica is a nice cafe nestled in the corner of Yorkdale Mall although it's often packed. It's a nice place to take a break or to hop off the TTC for a coffee when it's not busy. The cafe interior is beautiful with it's coffee-bag decor and it's playful use of mirrors. Although there are seats- I wouldn't really stay for too long.",
