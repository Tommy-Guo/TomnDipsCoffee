  "general_desc": "This cafe boasts a stunning modern industrial interior, with sleek metal accents and exposed brick that give it a stylish, contemporary vibe. It's the kind of place where you'd expect to find great coffee, but sadly, the brew didnâ€™t live up to the ambiance. While the setting is perfect for hanging out, the coffee left much to be desired.",
