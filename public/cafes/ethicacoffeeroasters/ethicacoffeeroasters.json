  "general_desc": "Ethica Coffee Roasters is a lovely & lively cafe! There are tons of seats and they offer a choice of beans for whichever drink you choose. There's tons of seating in their open modern industrial cafe. We're not too sure how often, though they had a live jazz band when we visited, bringing some liveliness to an otherwise quiet street.\n\nEthica is more than just a cafe, they feature their in-house roasted beans, art work, coffee merch & equipment, and a variety of snacks and treats!",
